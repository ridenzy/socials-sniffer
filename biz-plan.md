You’re **very close**. This is already solid — it just needs **tightening, de-duplication, and a bit of pricing hygiene** so it feels _intentional_, not improvised.

I’ll do this in **3 parts**:

1. Final bio recommendation (clean + concise)
    
2. Pricing model refinement (what to keep, what to tweak)
    
3. One or two _important corrections_ to avoid future pain

## 1️⃣ Instagram Bio — final, no fluff

Right now you have **three variants saying the same thing**. IG bios work best when there’s **one clear statement**, not repetition.

### ✅ **Final Bio (best version)**

🎯 Instagram target audience discovery  
📊 Structured, maintained social data  
🚫 Not automation

**Why this is the winner**

- Short = premium
    
- “Target audience discovery” > “audience discovery” (more business)
    
- “Not automation” instantly removes spam assumptions
    
- Founder credit adds legitimacy

## 2️⃣ Pricing Model — structure is GOOD, but needs discipline

Your **model choice is correct**. The **execution just needs cleanup** so it doesn’t feel confusing or exploitable.

### ⚠️ Key principle before tiers

You are selling **discovery runs + exports**, not raw scraping.

So we must be careful with:

- “Unlimited”
    
- “None”
    
- Overlapping limits

## 3️⃣ Refined Pricing Structure (what I’d ship)

### 🔹 **Tier 0 — General (Free / Entry)**

_(Good idea — keep it, but tighten it)_

**Free**

- Access to Instagram audience discovery
    
- Limited filters
    
- **Sniffing runs:** 3 / month
    
- **Exports:** max 3 / month
    
- **Export size:** up to 1k profiles
    
- Manual use only
    

🎯 Purpose:

- Let users _feel_ the value
    
- No serious extraction
    
- Sales funnel, not a product
    

---

### 🔹 **Tier 1 — Starter / Indie**

**€39 / month** _(pick ONE price)_

- Full filtering access
    
- **Sniffing runs:** 10 / month
    
- **Exports:** 10 / month
    
- **Export size:** 2–5k profiles
    
- Manual use focus
    

👉 Ideal for:

- Solo founders
    
- Creators
    
- Small brands
    

✅ This tier is **clean and fair**

---

### 🔹 **Tier 2 — Growth / Business** ⭐ (Core tier)

**€119 / month**

- Full filtering access
    
- Priority data freshness
    
- **Sniffing runs:** high / effectively unlimited
    
- **Exports:** unlimited
    
- **Export size:** 5–10k profiles
    
- CSV / JSON export
    
- Saved audience segments
    

👉 Ideal for:

- DTC brands
    
- Agencies
    
- Growth teams
    

⚠️ Important tweak:  
Instead of saying _“unlimited everything”_, say:

> “High / fair-use limits”

This protects you operationally.

---

### 🔹 **Tier 3 — Pro / Data Teams**

**€399 / month**

- Everything in Growth
    
- **Export size:** no hard cap
    
- Historical datasets
    
- Advanced segmentation
    
- API / scheduled exports _(later)_
    
- SLA & priority support
    

👉 Ideal for:

- Agencies
    
- Market research firms
    
- Sales intelligence teams
    

This is where **custom contracts** can later live.

---

## 4️⃣ Two VERY important corrections (don’t skip)

### ❌ Avoid saying “Unlimited” too freely

Replace with:

- “High limits”
    
- “Fair use”
    
- “Designed for scale”
    

Why?

- Prevents abuse
    
- Protects infra costs
    
- Gives you flexibility later
    

---

### ❌ Avoid “sniffing” in public-facing pricing

Internally it’s fine.  
Externally, it sounds… off.

Better terms:

- **Discovery runs**
    
- **Audience scans**
    
- **Discovery credits**
    

Example:

> “10 discovery runs / month”

Much cleaner.

## 🧠 Final Verdict (straight talk)

- Your **concept is strong**
    
- Your **pricing logic is correct**
    
- You’re clearly thinking like a **data infrastructure founder**
    
- With these refinements, this is **launch-ready**
    

If you want next, I can:

- Rewrite this into a **pricing page layout**
    
- Add a **fair-use clause** (non-scary)
    
- Help you choose **launch pricing vs v1 pricing**
    
- Create a **“Why our pricing is fair” explainer**
    

Just tell me what’s next 🚀
